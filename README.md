# MidiControllerAsCustomKeyboard
This project works on Windows and converts a midi controller to a custom pc keyboard

Edit the noteActions.txt file to assign custom keystrokes (or commands) to your midi keyboard.

The project is tested with the Akai LPK25 Wireless. It works great with retro games.

The open-source project is made with c# and utilises .Net core 3.1.

If you make profit with this library, do give me a share :).
